It was first discovered by Sir Humphrey Davis in the year 1808 when he electrolysed magnesium oxide and mercuric oxide. Magnesium is the fourth-most abundant element in the earth's crust and the ninth-most common element in the universe. It is produced in stars three times the size of our sun. It is an essential element for all living things. It is most commonly found as a solid. Today, Magnesium is used in fireworks, as well as paint, among other things.

It is a non-metal. It is sometimes considered a metalloid. It was first discovered in prehistoric times - as what is left after burning a fire is amorphous carbon. Carbon is found by itself naturally is present in all living organisms on earth. Hence, it is not a rare element. It is the 15th most abundant element in the earth's crust . It has three key isotopes, carbon-12, carbon-13 and carbon-14. It is most commonly found as a solid, and has a extremely high melting and boiling points. In its diamond form, it sublimes, going straight from a solid to a gas because of how strong its inter-atomic bonds are. "

It was first discovered in 1772. Carbon is found by itself as dinitrogen. It is the fifth most common element in the universe and makes up 78% of the earth's atmosphere. Hence, it is not a rare element. It has one key isotope, nitrogen-14. It has a relatively low melting and boiling points. Today, nitrogen is used for making ammonia, which is used for fertilisers and explosives, as well as nitric acid. Nitrogen is largely inert. "

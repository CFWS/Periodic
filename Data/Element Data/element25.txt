It is not found as a free element in nature, and if often found in combination with iron and in many minerals. Manganese oxidises in air, and hence is somewhat reactive. It is paramagnetic, along with its common ions. Today, it is used in deoxidising and sulphur-fixing steel, as well as in aluminium alloys and vehicle fuels. "

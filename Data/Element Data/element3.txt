It was first discovered in the mineral petalite Lithium is not found by itself naturally, and is always in a compound. Today, lithium is obtained by electrolysing lithium chloride. It makes up 0.0007% of the earth’s crust. Today, lithium is used in heat-transfer procedures, such as to make glass and ceramics. It has one key isotope, which is Lithium-7. It is most commonly found as a solid, and has a relatively low melting point and a high boiling point. Lithium can be alloyed with other metals, including aluminium, and reacts with water. "

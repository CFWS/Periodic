It is the ninth-most abundant element in the earth’s crust, and can be alloyed with other metals like iron, aluminium, vanadium and molybdenum. It is not particularly volatile, and can be found by itself in nature. It is used today in jet engines, industrial processes, and medical equipment and implants. "

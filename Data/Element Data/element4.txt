It is a strong, lightweight metal, belonging to the group of alkaline earth metals. It was first discovered in the emeralds (Be3Al2(SiO3)6)Beryllium is not found by itself naturally, and has a short life, synthesised in stars. Hence, it is a rare element in the universe. Today, lithium can be obtained by electrolysing molten beryllium chloride and sodium chloride, though this is not the only way. There are trace amounts found in the earth's crust and atmosphere. Today, lithium is used in the nuclear industry and ceramics. It has one key isotope, which is Beryllium-9. It is most commonly found as a solid, and has a extremely high melting and boiling points. Lithium can be alloyed with other metals, including copper. "

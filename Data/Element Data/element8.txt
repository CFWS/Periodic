It was first discovered in 1774. Oxygen is found bonded with one other oxygen atom. It is the third most common element in the universe and makes up 21% of the earth's atmosphere, and nearly half of the crust's mass. Hence, it is not a rare element. It has one key isotope, oxygen-16. It has a relatively low melting and boiling points. Today, oxygen is used for rocket fuel and welding among many other things. Oxygen is highly reactive and reacts with nearly all other elements. "

It is a strong, lightweight metal, belonging to the group of alkaline earth metals. It was first discovered in the emeralds (Be3Al2(SiO3)6)Boron is not found by itself naturally and is produced by cosmic ray spallation. Hence, it is a rare element in the universe. Today, boron can be obtained by heating borax with carbon, though this is not the only way. There are trace amounts found in the earth's crust and atmosphere. Today, boron is used in the fireworks and rockets. It has one key isotope, which is Boron-11. It is most commonly found as a solid, and has a extremely high melting and boiling points. "

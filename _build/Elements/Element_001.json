  "Element Description": "Hydrogen is colourless and odourless. It is present in all of the molecules of living things, and is also found in our sun and most of the stars. It is the most abundant element in the universe. On earth, it is most abundantly found in water.  It is most commonly found as a gas, and has extremely low melting and boiling points. It is the least dense gas. "

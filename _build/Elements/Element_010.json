  "Element Description": "Neon is a noble gas, most commonly found as a gas. It was first discovered in 1898. Neon can be found by itself in nature. Neon is quite common, being the fourth most common element in the universe, however it only makes up 0.0018% of the earth's atmosphere. Hence, it is a somewhat rare element. It has one key isotope, neon-20. It has a very low melting and boiling points. Today, neon is used in advertising signs as well as lasers, among other things. "

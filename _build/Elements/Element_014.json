  "Element Description": "Silicon is a  is a silver, lustrous metalloid. It was first discovered by Jons Jacob Berzelius in the year 1824. Silicon is the second-most abundant element in the earth's crust, and the eighth-most common element in the universe. It is rarely found in its pure form in nature. It is most commonly found as a solid. Today, silicon is used as a semiconductor, among other things. "

  "Element Description": "Calcium is a metal that is soft-grey in appearance. A soft metal, it is somewhat reactive and is one of the most abundant metals on earth. To be precise, it is the fifth-most-abundant element dissolved in seawater, as well as in the earth’s crust. It is essential for many living organisms, and is the most abundant metal by mass in many animals. Today, calcium is used in cements and alloys. "

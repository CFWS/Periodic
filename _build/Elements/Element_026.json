  "Element Description": "Iron is a lustrous, greyish metal in the first transition series. It is the most common element on earth by mass, forming much of the outer and inner core. It is the fourth most abundant element in the earth’s crust. It is somewhat reactive, and can be found very commonly as a free element in nature. Today, it is the most widely applied of all the metal, accounting for 95% of the world’s metal production. It is used in machinery, tools, cars, ships, buildings and many other things. "

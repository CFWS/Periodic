  "Element Description": "Phosphorus is a  is a non-metal that is found in different forms: colourless, waxy white, yellow, scarlet, red, violet and black. It was first discovered by Hennig Brand when he tried to derive gold from urine, inadvertently isolating phosphorus in the year 1669. Phosphorus is found in vast amounts in the earth's rock, however it is spread far and dilute. It is found in its pure form in nature sometimes, although it is mostly found in mineral rocks. Today, phosphorus is used to create fertiliser, among other things. "

  "Element Description": "Vanadium is a blue-silver-grey metal transition metal that his highly malleable.  It is quite reactive, and cannot be found by itself in nature. However, once it is isolated artificially, an oxide layer forms and stabilises the free metal against further oxidisation. It has an abundance of 0.25%. Today, vanadium is used in alloys to create vanadium steel and to increase the strength of titanium. "

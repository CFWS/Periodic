  "Element Description": "Sodium is a soft, silvery-whitish metal. It was first discovered by Sir Humphrey Davis in the year 1807 when he electrolysed sodium hydroxide. Sodium is the sixth-most abundant element in the earth's crust, and exists in minerals including sodalite and rock salt. It is an essential element for all animals and some plants to live. It is most commonly found as a solid. Today, Sodium is used in the production of many materials, including titanium. It is also used as a coolant in nuclear operations. Sodium is highly reactive, and is never found by itself naturally. "

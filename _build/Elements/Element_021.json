  "Element Description": "Scandium is a metal that is sometimes classified as a rare earth element. It occurs as a silvery white metal, and is rare. It is most commonly found with deposits of other rare earth and uranium compounds. It is the 50th most common element on the earth, but the 23rd most common in the sun. It is somewhat reactive, and oxidises in the air. Today, scandium is used mainly in the aerospace industry, and alloyed with aluminium in aircraft parts. "

  "Element Description": "Argon is a non-metal noble gas that occurs as a colourless and odourless gas that exhibits a lilac glow when placed in an electric field. It makes up 0.93% of the earth’s atmosphere, as the third most common gas. As a noble gas, it is highly stable and unreactive. Today, it is used only for industrial uses, such as in furnaces to prevent graphite from melting and in incandescent and fluorescent lighting. "

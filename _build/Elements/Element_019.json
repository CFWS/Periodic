  "Element Description": "Potassium is a metal that is silvery-white in appearance. It is soft and must be stored in oil to stop it rapidly oxidising in the air. A solid at room temperature, it is highly reactive, and the seventh most abundant element in the earth’s crust.  It is also chemically very similar to sodium. Today, potassium is used primarily for making fertiliser. "

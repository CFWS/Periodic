  "Element Description": "Sulphur is a non-metal that has an appearance of lemon-yellow microcrystals. A solid at room temperature, sulphur crushes easily and is can be readily crushed into a fine powder. As it is abundantly found on earth, it is not volatile, although it oxidises most metals and some non-metals, reacting with them in that way. Today, sulphur is used primarily in fertilisers. "

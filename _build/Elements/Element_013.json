  "Element Description": "Aluminium is a strong, silver and lustrous metal. It was first discovered by Hand Christian Oersted in the year 1825. Aluminium is the most abundant element in the earth's crust, although it is not naturally found by itself because it is so reactive. It is most commonly found as a solid. Today, aluminium is used in when light and strong metals are needed, such as aircraft frames, among other things. "

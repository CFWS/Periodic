  "Element Description": "Chlorine is a non-metal that occurs as a yellow-tinged gas at room temperature. It is highly dangerous at high concentrations, and poisonous for all living organisms. It the second most abundant halogen and twenty-first most abundant element in the earth's crust. Its most common compound is table salt, sodium chloride. It is highly reactive and a strong oxidising agent. Today, chlorine is used for bleaching and disinfectant. "

  "Element Description": "Fluorine is a halogen, most commonly found as a gas. It was first discovered in 1886. Fluorine is never found by itself, as it is the most reactive of all elements. Many scientists tried to isolate it but were injured or killed in the process because it is so violently reactive. Fluorine is unusually rare for such a light element, and is the 24th most common element in the universe. Hence, it is a somewhat rare element. It has one key isotope, fluorine-19. It has a relatively low melting and boiling points. Today, fluorine is used to prevent tooth decay, and is used to also etch glass, among other things. "
